# Simple_AI_Gomoku

A simple game bot for the game manager Piskvork

GAME RULES
This is a 2-player game that is played on a 19x19 game board (called goban). Contrary to full rules, we use a very simplified version here :
Every player plays a stone at his/her turn, and the game ends as soon as one has a 5 stones in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonaay) - and thus wins.


PROJECT RULES
• 5 seconds maximum per move,
• 70 MB of memory per bot,
• a forbidden move automatically leads to defeat,
• the use of a forbidden library leads to elimination (only standard libraries are allowed)
